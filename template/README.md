# Mule Application Template

This application demonstrates how to publish a simple Mule Application Template to Exchange using Exchange Maven Facade v3 API. It's similar to the Mule Application project but in this case it's published as type 'Template'. Exchange defines 'Templates' as Packaged integration patterns built on best practices to address common use cases.

### How to publish to Exchange

1. Make sure you have executed the `grep` command explained in the root [README.md](../README.md) file of this repository
2. Execute the following command in your console
```
mvn clean deploy -DskipTests
```
3. If everything is ok youâ€™ll get:
```
