# Mule application

This project demonstrates how to publish a simple Mule Application to Exchange using Exchange Maven Facade v3 API.

### How to publish to Exchange

1. Make sure you have executed the `grep` command explained in the root [README.md](../README.md) file of this repository
2. Execute the following command in your console
```
mvn clean deploy -DskipTests
```
3. If everything is ok youâ€™ll get:
```
